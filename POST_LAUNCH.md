# ReignScore - Post-Launch Strategy (Phase 9)

## 1. Analytics & Monitoring
**Goal**: Understand user behavior and catch errors early.

### Status: IMPLEMENTED
*   **Sentry**: Installed and Configured (`@sentry/react-native`). *Action: Update DSN in `app/_layout.tsx`.*
*   **PostHog**: Integrated (`posthog-react-native`).

## 2. ASO (App Store Optimization)
**Goal**: Maximize visibility and downloads through targeted keywords and visuals.

### Keywords (Expanded):
*   "Credit Builder"
*   "Credit score tracker"
*   "Credit card optimizer"
*   "Credit utilization"
*   "7 day rule credit"
*   "Dispute credit report"
*   "Credit repair app"
*   "Financial wellness"
*   "Score Simulator"
*   "Gamified Finance"

### Visual Assets (Screenshots Required):
Capture high-res screens of these 6 key views:
1.  **Reign Score Dashboard**: The main view (Dark Mode).
2.  **Score Simulator**: Showing a score increase simulation.
3.  **Noble Plan**: The premium upgrade card/screen.
4.  **Reign Guard**: Dispute management screen (Differentiator).
5.  **Card Optimizer**: 7-Day Rule payment reminder (Unique Selling Point).
6.  **Crowns & Rewards**: Gamification elements showing points/status.

*Action*: User to provide text overlays/captions for these screenshots.

## 3. Feature Roadmap & Community

### Real Data Integration (Priority)
*   **Plaid Production**: This is a core feature, not a roadmap item.
*   **Action**: Once Plaid approves production access, switch app from Simulation Mode to Live Data immediately.

### Community (Hold)
*   **Discord/Forum**: Hold launch until 100+ paying Noble/Emperor members to ensure activity.
